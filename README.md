# Foam-Drainage-Simulator
## The Science:
[Sclerosing Foams](https://www.riaendovascular.com/services/foam-sclerotherapy/) are mixtures of a surfactant solution with room air that are produced in-house by clinicians and are administered to treat [varicose veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicose_veins).

As mixtured of liquid and gas, sclerosing foams are thermodynamically unstable; meaning as time passes by, the liquid content draings and bubbles coarse and coalesce together. One way to quantify foam stability, is by calculating its "half-life" (the time required for half of the liquid content of the foam to drain). In a [previous article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0268355515589063#_i15), we have characterised the half-life of sclerosing foams manufactured 

Typically, sclerosing foams are injected into the patient's veins using a syringe. An gap of information in the literature is:
  
## Does the act of injection speed up the rate o ageing?
